# ChipperGame
a simple idle game about computer chips and logic  
yea thats about it, i curently have been making it build from the script file, making a fancy bit that lets you mak your own names for things, a way to change the styling of the webpage, andgenerally everything i don't need to do right now to make it an actual game!
